Nginx ssl config:

+ ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;: Specifies the version(s) of the SSL/TLS protocol to be used. This line enables TLS version 1.3.

+ ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;: This setting tells the web server to use the cipher suites that are preferred by the server, rather than those preferred by the client.

+ ssl_ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM;: Specifies the cipher suites that can be used for encryption. This line specifies two cipher suites, which are used in order of preference.

+ ssl_session_timeout 10m;: Specifies how long SSL/TLS session data should be cached on the server. This line sets the cache timeout to 10 minutes.

+ ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;: Specifies the type of cache to use for SSL/TLS session data. This line sets up a shared cache with a 10-minute timeout.

+ ssl_session_tickets off;: Disables session ticket support, which can improve security by reducing the amount of session data that needs to be stored on the server.

+ ssl_stapling on;: Enables SSL stapling, which allows the server to provide proof of its SSL/TLS certificate's validity to the client.

+ ssl_stapling_verify on;: Enables verification of SSL/TLS stapling, which helps to ensure the validity of the certificate.

+ resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 valid=300s;: Specifies the DNS resolver to use for SSL/TLS certificate verification, and sets a timeout for cache entries.

+ resolver_timeout 5s;: Sets a timeout for DNS resolver queries.

+ add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;: Adds a response header to prevent the page from being displayed within an iframe.

+ add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;: Adds a response header to prevent browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than what is declared.

+ add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";: Adds a response header to enable the browser's XSS (cross-site scripting) protection.
